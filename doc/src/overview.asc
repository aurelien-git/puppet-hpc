= Overview

Puppet-HPC is a Puppet Configuration designed to easily be used for HPC
clusters. The main goal of Puppet-HPC is to provide a generic configuration
that can be reused effortlessly for different clusters or sites. This implies a
strict separation between cluster-specific or site-specific data from Puppet
code.

Puppet-HPC is developed and actively maintained by the CCN-HPC (Centre de
Compétences Nationales en High Performance Computing) of https://www.edf.fr[EDF]
(Électrité de France).
