[[installation]]
= Installation

Installing the configuration will depend of your cluster topology. This chapter
describes two installation patterns, the first uses a shared Posix storage, the
second pushes the configuration on a central storage and pull it on the node
with Posix or  HTTP(S).

[[install-shared-admin]]
== Shared `/admin`

In this setup, a storage space is mounted on every nodes of the cluster
and the configuration is applied directly from this storage space. By
default this space is mounted on `/admin`, using another mount point
should not be difficult.

On simple systems, it is possible to use an NFS server to make `/admin`
available on all nodes. It is also possible to bootstrap the cluster
with a `/admin` on the _Admin Server_ exported by NFS and later move it
to a more resilient location (HA NFS, CephFS or GPFS).

[[install-shared-admin-directory-layout]]
=== Directory layout

The layout setup should be done on the first node with `/admin`
available. This is generally the _Admin Server_.

* `/admin`
* `restricted`
** `puppet-hpc` (A git clone of the puppet-hpc repository)
*** `puppet-config`
*** `hieradata`
** `hpc-privatedata` (Frequently another git repository)
*** `hieradata`
*** `files`
** `hieradata`
*** `generic` (Symbolic link to `/admin/restricted/puppet-hpc/hieradata`)
*** `private` (Symbolic link to `/admin/restricted/hpc-privatedata/hieradata`)
** `privatefiles` (Symbolic link to `/admin/restricted/hpc-privatedata/files`)
* `public`
** `http`

[[install-shared-admin-puppet]]
=== Puppet

Puppet must be configured to search for the modules in the shared
`/admin`. The following file can be used on debian and also search
modules installed with debian packages:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[main]
logdir=/var/log/puppet
vardir=/var/lib/puppet
ssldir=/var/lib/puppet/ssl
rundir=/var/run/puppet
basemodulepath=$confdir/modules:/usr/share/puppet/modules:/admin/restricted/puppet-hpc/puppet-config/cluster:/admin/restricted/puppet-hpc/puppet-config/modules:/admin/restricted/puppet-hpc/puppet-config/modules_3rdparty
prerun_command=/etc/puppet/etckeeper-commit-pre
postrun_command=/etc/puppet/etckeeper-commit-post
stringify_facts=false
hiera_config=/etc/puppet/hiera.yaml

[master]
# These are needed when the puppetmaster is run by passenger
# and can safely be removed if webrick is used.
ssl_client_header = SSL_CLIENT_S_DN 
ssl_client_verify_header = SSL_CLIENT_VERIFY
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[install-shared-admin-hiera-eyaml]]
=== Hiera-eyaml

It is recomended to use https://github.com/TomPoulton/hiera-eyaml[Hiera
EYAML] to store secret values. The keys must be created on the first
node.

------------------------------------------------
# mkdir /etc/puppet/secure
# cd /etc/puppet/secure/
# eyaml createkeys
[hiera-eyaml-core] Created key directory: ./keys
Keys created OK
# chown -R puppet:puppet /etc/puppet/secure/keys
# chmod -R 0500 /etc/puppet/secure/keys
# chmod 0400 /etc/puppet/secure/keys/*.pem
------------------------------------------------

To configure `eyaml(1)` itself, the following file should be created:
`/etc/eyaml/config.yaml`

------------------------------------------------------------------
---
pkcs7_private_key: '/etc/puppet/secure/keys/private_key.pkcs7.pem'
pkcs7_public_key: '/etc/puppet/secure/keys/public_key.pkcs7.pem'
------------------------------------------------------------------

Hiera is configured to search for values in the generic configuration
repository, then in a few files for all nodes, then in files specific
for each _role_.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
:backends:
  - eyaml
:eyaml:
  :datadir:           /admin/restricted/hieradata
  :pkcs7_private_key: /etc/puppet/secure/keys/private_key.pkcs7.pem
  :pkcs7_public_key:  /etc/puppet/secure/keys/public_key.pkcs7.pem
  :extension:         'yaml'
:hierarchy:
  - private/default/roles/%{puppet_role}
  - generic/default/roles/%{puppet_role}
  - private/cluster
  - private/network
  - private/default
  - generic/common
  - generic/%{osfamily}/common
-------------------------------------------------------------------

[[install-shared-admin-common]]
=== Common steps

Some <<install-common, common steps>> must be performed.

[[install-shared-admin-node-bootstraping]]
=== Node bootstraping

Setting up the directory layout can be done once, but you will still
have to do some bootstraping on other newly installed nodes. Those steps
will be handled by the bootsystem eventually.

The steps are:

* Installing puppet
* Distributing the puppet configuration
* Distributing the hiera configuration and keys
* Mounting `/admin`
* Apply puppet

[[install-dev-push-apply]]
== Development Push & Apply

With this pattern, modifications to the Puppet HPC Configuration are pushed
from local directories, to a central storage. The push is done through to a
mounted filesystem, but it will eventually support a push with SSH and HTTP.

image::src/img/dev_config_push_apply.png[image]

The push script (`dev-hpc-config-push.sh`) will create a tarball with the
content of the modules and the hieradata configuration. Applying the
configuration uses the script that will eventually be used in production
(`hpc-config-apply`).

In this setup, the apply script downloads the puppet configuration (modules and
hiera data) as a tarball and installs it as an environment in `/etc/puppet`.
Private data files are not downloaded with the configuration. Private data
files are available from the central storage and are directly downloaded from
the puppet modules.

[[install-dev-push-apply-directory-layout]]
=== Directory layout

Source directories (git puppet-hpc and git hpc-privatedata), can be placed
anywhere on the Admin/Development machine. They should be in the same place though.

* `<SOME DIRECTORY>`
** `puppet-hpc` (a git clone of the puppet-hpc repository)
** `hpc-privatedata` a directory containing cluster specific data, frequently another git repository)
*** `hieradata`
*** `files`

The destination should be shared between the development host and the central
storage. This can be an NFS space. This restriction is meant to be removed
eventually. This is because the push to destination is a simple `cp`, it should
support SFTP and HTTP push.

The destination is `/admin/public/http/mirror/hpc-config`. The paths described
here can be modified directly in the script: `scripts/dev-hpc-config-push.sh`.

[[install-dev-push-apply-puppet]]
=== Puppet

Puppet must be installed and configured to use
https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/3.7/reference/environments_configuring.html[Directory 
Environments]. To do this, use the following `/etc/puppet/puppet.conf`:

-------
[main]
logdir=/var/log/puppet
vardir=/var/lib/puppet
ssldir=/var/lib/puppet/ssl
rundir=/var/run/puppet
environmentpath = $confdir/environments
prerun_command=/etc/puppet/etckeeper-commit-pre
postrun_command=/etc/puppet/etckeeper-commit-post
stringify_facts=false
hiera_config=$confdir/hiera.yaml

[master]
# These are needed when the puppetmaster is run by passenger
# # and can safely be removed if webrick is used.
# ssl_client_header = SSL_CLIENT_S_DN 
# ssl_client_verify_header = SSL_CLIENT_VERIFY
-------

Create the base environments directory:

-------
# mkdir /etc/puppet/environments
-------

[[install-dev-push-apply-hiera-eyaml]]
=== Hiera eyaml

It is recomended to use https://github.com/TomPoulton/hiera-eyaml[Hiera
EYAML] to store secret values. The keys must be created on the first
node.

------------------------------------------------
# mkdir /etc/puppet/secure
# cd /etc/puppet/secure/
# eyaml createkeys
[hiera-eyaml-core] Created key directory: ./keys
Keys created OK
# chown -R puppet:puppet /etc/puppet/secure/keys
# chmod -R 0500 /etc/puppet/secure/keys
# chmod 0400 /etc/puppet/secure/keys/*.pem
------------------------------------------------

To configure `eyaml(1)` itself, the following file should be created:
`/etc/eyaml/config.yaml`

------------------------------------------------------------------
---
pkcs7_private_key: '/etc/puppet/secure/keys/private_key.pkcs7.pem'
pkcs7_public_key: '/etc/puppet/secure/keys/public_key.pkcs7.pem'
------------------------------------------------------------------

Hiera is configured to search for values in the generic configuration
repository, then in a few files for all nodes, then in files specific
for each _role_. This is done in the file `/etc/puppet/hiera.yaml`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
:backends:
  - eyaml
:eyaml:
  :datadir:           /etc/puppet/environments/%{environment}/hieradata
  :pkcs7_private_key: /etc/puppet/secure/keys/private_key.pkcs7.pem
  :pkcs7_public_key:  /etc/puppet/secure/keys/public_key.pkcs7.pem
  :extension:         'yaml'
:hierarchy:
  - private/default/roles/%{puppet_role}
  - generic/default/roles/%{puppet_role}
  - private/cluster
  - private/network
  - private/default
  - generic/common
  - generic/%{osfamily}/common
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The apply script will fetch the keys with the configuration. You must create a
tarball with the keys and put it in a place where the apply script can fetch
it. In the example below, it is placed with the puppet-configuration:

---------
# cd /etc/puppet/secure
# tar cJf /admin/public/http/mirror/keys/keys.tar.xz key
---------

Please not this setup is quite insecure, on a production system, the central
storage for this file should only be accessible by root users on node. The apply
script can prove an http request originates from a root user by using a source port
in the 1-1023 range.

[[install-dev-push-apply-common]]
=== Common steps

Some <<install-common, common steps>> must be performed.

[[install-dev-push-apply-usage]]
=== Usage

To push, from the admin/development host:
-----------
$ <SOME DIRECTORY>/puppet-hpc/scripts/dev-hpc-config-push.sh
## Creating env structure
## Creating env modules generic
cp: cannot overwrite directory '/tmp/puppet-config-production-zARV/production/modules_generic/stdlib' with non-directory
## Creating env modules private
## Creating env hieradata
## Creating env config
## Building Destination
## Cleaning
$
-----------

From a node, you must call the `hpc-config-apply` script with sources for keys and Puppet HPC configuration:

-----
# <SOME DIRECTORY>/hpc-config-apply -k http://genmisc/keys -s http://genmisc/hpc-config -v
INFO:root:Getting secure keys from http://genmisc/keys/keys.tar.xz
INFO:root:Getting Puppet HPC configuration environment from http://genmisc/hpc-config/production/latest/puppet-config-environment.tar.xz

The `-v` switch increases verbosity.

You can use a configuration file to not always give the source, by default in `/etc/hpc-config.conf`:

-----
[DEFAULT]
environment=production

[production]
source=http://genmisc/hpc-config/
keys_source=http://genmisc/keys/
-----

The full usage for `hpc-config-apply` is:

-----
usage: hpc-config-apply [-h] [--config [CONFIG_FILE]] [--source [SOURCE]]
                        [--environment [ENVIRONMENT]]
                        [--deploy-step [{production,usbdisk}]]
                        [--keys-source [KEYS_SOURCE]] [--verbose]

Apply the HPC Configuration.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --config [CONFIG_FILE], -c [CONFIG_FILE]
                        Configuration file
  --source [SOURCE], -s [SOURCE]
                        Configuration source URL
  --environment [ENVIRONMENT], -e [ENVIRONMENT]
                        Environment name
  --deploy-step [{production,usbdisk}], -d [{production,usbdisk}]
                        Deploy step
  --keys-source [KEYS_SOURCE], -k [KEYS_SOURCE]
                        Secret keys source
  --verbose, -v         More output, can be specified multiple times.

[[install-common]]
== Common steps

This sections presents steps that should be applied with all installation
patterns.

[[install-common-cluster-decrypt-password]]
=== Cluster Decrypt Password

A decrypt password is used by clara to decrypt files. Once you have
generated this password, it should be in your hiera under this
structure:

-----------------------------------------------------
cluster_decrypt_password: 'PASSWORD_TO_PUT_IN_EYAML'
clara::password_options:      
  ASUPASSWD:   "%{hiera('cluster_decrypt_password')}"
-----------------------------------------------------

This password is used elsewhere in the hiera, generally under the name
`decrypt_password` (for example: `openssh::server::decrypt_passwd`). So we
define a top level variable (`cluster_decrypt_password`) to reuse it
more easily.

[[install-common-cluster-keyring]]
=== Cluster keyring

The cluster must use a private cluster keyring. This keyring is used to
sign packages generated locally and the local repositories.

You should generate it in your privatedata. You will be asked for a
passphrase, this passphrase must be provided interactively when you call
`clara repo add|del`. The following command can be pretty long to
execute if you don't use a hardware Random Number Generator (RNG).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 # LANG=C gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring files/repo/cluster_keyring.gpg --secret-keyring files/repo/cluster_keyring.secret.gpg --gen-key                       gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.18; Copyright (C) 2014 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.

passphrase not correctly repeated; try again.
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
