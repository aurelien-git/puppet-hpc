= Overview

== What is provided?

The goal of the configuration is to provide a common configuration for HPC
clusters. The Puppet HPC configuration provides:

* Generic Puppet modules for tools commonly used in HPC clusters, these
  modules can be provided directly or coming from third party sources (mainly
  the puppetlabs forge)
* Specialized Puppet modules that can only work with the rest of the
  configuration, these modules rely on data provided by *hiera*
* A generic *hiera* configuration to provide some defaults
* A series of scripts and tools to apply, fetch and debug the configuration

== What is missing?

The Puppet HPC configuration can not be applied directly, it must be configured
for a specific cluster or site. This configuration is done by using *hiera*.
This configuration should at least define the cluster (See:
<<cluster-definition, Cluster Definition>>).

It's also possible to expand the puppet modules to include custom modification
or support for software and product not implemented in the common
configuration.

== Workflow

The final configuration in Puppet is called the *Catalog*, the catalog is
computed from:

* The site main *manifest* (`site.pp`) 
* The puppet modules included
* *hiera*
* The facts (native or from the modules)

In the hiera configuration, it is possible to reference facts and top level
variables. Top level variable are defined by the site manifest.

The Puppet HPC configuration is particular because some facts (from the
`hpclib` module) are defined from the cluster definition that is stored in
hiera.

== Customization

The aim of the configuration is to provide a common configuration base between
multiple clusters and to cleanly separate configuration data from logic. This
means that the primary tool for a system administrator should be to modify the
hiera private configuration.

If a configuration can not be handled only by modifying hiera, it should be
added as a custom module and not by modifying the Puppet HPC manifest directly.

Systems administrators are encouraged to open issues with the Puppet HPC
configuration project on github in those situation. The modification might make
sense on other sites or be a new default.
