== Internal repository

Puppet-HPC can not be used only on its own, it must be configured for a specific
site and a specific cluster. It is recommended to work with an additional
internal repository that will contain all specific data that can not be
published on GitHub.

The content and structure of this internal repository is explained below:

* `files` contains any configuration file that needs to be stored internally
and that can be used as it is in a cluster configuration. It can be, for example
, SSL certificates, SSH host keys, etc. If the content of these files is
sensitive, they should be encrypted.
* `hieradata` contains all the site-specific and cluster-specific data
necessary to configure a cluster with Puppet-HPC.
* `puppet-config` includes some Puppet configuration files to use with a
specific cluster such as `puppet.conf`, `hiera.yaml`.

For each of these three directories, it is recommended to have a subdirectory per
cluster being configured with Puppet-HPC.
