external community modules that can be considered as dependencies. The full
list of these modules is:

* https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/stdlib[`puppetlabs-stdlib`]
* https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/concat[`puppetlabs-concat`]
* https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/apache[`puppetlabs-apache`]
* https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/apt[`puppetlabs-apt`]
* https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/ntp[`puppetlabs-ntp`]
* https://forge.puppet.com/arioch/keepalived[`arioch-keepalived`]
* https://forge.puppet.com/herculesteam/augeasproviders[`herculesteam-augeasproviders-{core,pam}`]

* https://forge.puppet.com/saz/rsyslog[`saz-rsyslog`]

It is also strongly recommended to install the
https://github.com/TomPoulton/hiera-eyaml[eyaml] utility in order to encrypt
sensitive data (such as passwords) inside the Hiera YAML files.
