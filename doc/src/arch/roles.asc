[[arch-roles]]
== Roles

As previously stated in the <<arch-pattern,pattern section>>, a node has exactly one
role representing its _business logic_, a role being nothing more than a set of
profiles. By design, all machines sharing the same role have the same set of
profiles. In other words, if it is necessary to apply a different set of
profiles to different machines, they must have different roles

In Puppet-HPC, the node-to-role association is set using a custom fact
`puppet_role` provided by the `hpclib` module. The fact actually extracts the
role name out of the hostname of the node, using the following pattern:

----
<prefix><role><id>
----

Where:

* `<prefix>` is the prefix of the cluster name (as provided by Hiera),
* `<role>` is the role name,
* `<id>` is a set of consecutive digits.

For example, on a cluster whose _prefix_ is `foo`, the role names extracted from
the following hostnames are:

* `foobar1`: `bar`
* `foocompute001`: `compute`
* `fooservice2boot001`: `service2boot`

This fact is then used in the <<arch-hieralayers,Hiera layers definitions>> to get a
role specific layer. The parameters values defined in this layer are specific to
the nodes having this role. This role specific layer of the Hiera repository is
primarily designed to set the list of profiles associated to the role, under the
generic `profiles` parameter name. As example, here is a possible value of this
parameter in file `<privatedata>/hieradata/<cluster_name>/roles/cn.yaml`:

----
profiles:
  - profiles::cluster::common
  - profiles::network::base
  - profiles::dns::client
  - profiles::access::base
  - profiles::ntp::client
  - profiles::ssmtp::client
  - profiles::jobsched::exec
  - profiles::openssh::server
  - profiles::environment::base
  - profiles::auth::client
  - profiles::metrics::collect_base
  - profiles::log::client
----

This parameter is extracted from the Hiera repository by the fully generic main
manifest of roles module `puppet-config/cluster/roles/manifests/init.pp`:

[source]
----
include::../../../puppet-config/cluster/roles/manifests/init.pp[]
----

In order to work as expected, this mechanism has the following requirements:

* All nodes must follow this naming convention.
* The prefix of the cluster name must be set with `cluster_prefix` parameter at
  the cluster level in the Hiera repository.
* The `profiles` parameter must be defined at the role specific layer of the
  Hiera repository, for all the possible roles.
