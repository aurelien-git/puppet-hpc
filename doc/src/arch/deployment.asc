== Deployment

Scibian clusters use a simple _puppet apply_ command with a set of modules,
manifests and data. Puppet-HPC is not designed to work in a traditional
"Puppet server" environment, as it must be used in a very simple system
environment, like a post installation script inside Debian Installer.

=== Push and apply scripts

Two tools have been developed in order to apply the puppet-hpc configuration
on the nodes of a cluster. One of the tools, "push" the entire configuration
(modules, Hiera data, files) in a shared space, and another one is aimed to
apply the configuration on the nodes.

==== hpc-config-push

This script merge all the data necessary to apply the puppet configuration in
one archive and push it into a shared storage:

* Puppet modules installed in operating system via packages
* Puppet modules from the _puppet_hpc_ git repository, including profiles
* Optionally other puppet modules
* Configuration files for Puppet and Hiera
* YAML files for Hiera: generic ones from puppet-hpc git repository and
  specific ones from the internal repository
* Files to copy on nodes from the internal repository

Two methods can be used to push the data:
* *posix*: simply copies the tarball into a shared directory on all nodes
  (a nfs export, for example)
* *s3*: uses the Amazon S3 RESTful API to send data on a compatible storage
  (Ceph Rados Gateway, for example)

The script can manage several
https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/3.7/environments.html[Puppet environments]
with the `-e, --environment` parameter. A default environment can be defined in
the configuration file.

The file `/etc/hpc-config/push.conf` allows to configure all the options for
this script.

Please refer to https://github.com/edf-hpc/puppet-hpc/blob/master/doc/manpages/hpc-config-push.md[`hpc-config-push(1)` man page]
for full usage documentation.

==== hpc-config-apply

This downloads the Puppet configuration (modules and hieradata)
as a tarball and installs it as an environment in `/etc/puppet`. Private data
files are not downloaded with the configuration, instead they are available
from  the central storage and are directly downloaded from the Puppet
modules.
If eyaml is used, this script needs a source to download the keys used to
encrypt and decrypt data.

The command `puppet apply` is executed afterward with the environment
previously untarred.

The configuration file indicating where to download the files is located in
_/etc/hpc-config.conf_.

Please refer to https://github.com/edf-hpc/puppet-hpc/blob/master/doc/manpages/hpc-config-apply.md[`hpc-config-apply(1)` man page]
for full usage documentation.

=== Packages

These two scripts are provided in the Scibian distribution as Debian packages:

* `hpc-config-apply`
* `hpc-config-push`
