= Internals - Roles and Profiles

[[overview]]
== Overview

The Puppet configuration for HPC clusters has been designed following
the *Roles and Profiles* pattern. The Puppet code is organized in
different levels of abstraction : 

* Roles, which represent the business
logic. A node includes one role, and one only. Each role lists one or
more profiles. 
* Profiles, which represent the implementation of
technical functionalities. A profile includes and manages modules to
define a logical technical stack. 
* Modules, which are the elementary
technical blocks. Modules should only be responsible for managing
aspects of the component they are written for and should be as generic
as possible.

== Background

Roles and Profiles is a common pattern in puppet code organisation. The pattern
is explained in details by this presentation:

== Implementation

=== Node classifiers

A role must be associated to a node. In the Puppet HPC configuration, it is 
assumed the node is named after its role. The naming rule for a node follows 
the pattern :
* `<prefix><role name><numerical ID>` (Example: `gencritical1`)
where `<prefix>` is the value of the variable `cluster_prefix` defined in Hiera.
To retrieve the role of a node, its hostname is analyzed by searching for the previous
pattern. This is done by the Ruby script `role.rb` of the `hpclib` module which 
defines the `puppet_role` fact.

=== Roles

In the Puppet HPC configuration, each role is associated to the list of profiles 
it includes.
The content of each role is specified in Hiera (`hieradata/default/roles`) in 
the corresponding YAML file `<role>.yaml`. This YAML file includes the definition 
of a `profiles` array,
which is the list of profiles the role is composed of.
A simple module (`puppet-config/cluster/roles`) is loading all the profile classes
defined in the Hiera `profiles` array. 
The configuration is providing some role definitions (critical, misc, batch, etc) 
but it is not mandatory 
to use them. Any site may define its own roles. That is why referencing a role by
referencing its name directly should be avoided. 

The module `hpclib` defines some facts that indicate which role includes a 
profile with some specific keywords in its name (`server`, `relay`, `mirror`,
`replica`, `tracker`). Looking at the facts on any node of the cluster, it is 
easy to know which role implements the DNS server or the LDAP replica for example.

=== Profiles

Profiles are classes grouped inside the `profiles` module 
(`puppet-config/cluster/profiles`). Each profile is a
feature for a host. That feature is built from technical components defined 
by modules. Profiles can rely heavily on Hiera to get the configuration
for the site. The profiles do not use auto-lookup but explicit `hiera` (or
`hiera_hash` and `hiera_array`) calls, this permits to control how data
coming from multiple hierarchy levels are merged.

The `profiles` module only defines classes, no resource, methods or facts. It
should not use templates or files. Profiles are meant to rely on the rest of
the Hiera/Puppet HPC configuration and may not work outside of it. Profiles can
call any class except other profiles.

=== HPC modules

HPC modules are modules that provide a lower level implementation of a technical
solution than a profile, but they still rely on the Puppet HPC configuration as a
whole. This includes modules that use facts defined by `hpclib`.

Those modules can use other modules and define resources, templates, files,
facts, functions... Their name can be prefixed by `hpc_`.

=== Generic modules

Generic modules implement a specific solution directly in a manner that is not
specific to the Puppet HPC configuration. These modules can not rely on data
other than class parameters or standard facts.

Modules must be able to work without Hiera. Despite the fact that these modules 
can be used independently of the Puppet HPC configuration, most of them have been 
created to be used in the context of an HPC cluster. As a result, the features they
support might seem incomplete for other uses. If you feel this way, please feel free
to contribute and add features to make our modules as generic as possible.

HPC and Generic modules are not strictly separated. Whether data specific to
the Puppet HPC configuration is used in the module or not is what makes a module 
falls into a category or the other.

=== Third Party modules

Usage of third party generic modules is encouraged when possible. The limitation
is that it should come from a reliable source: distribution package or
puppetlabs forge. For modules from the forge, support level should be *approved*
at least. Exceptions to this rule is possible if the module has been properly 
reviewed. The only exception right now is `puppetlabs-strings`.

Third party modules should be copied in the `puppet-config/modules_3rdparty`
directory. This may change in the future.
