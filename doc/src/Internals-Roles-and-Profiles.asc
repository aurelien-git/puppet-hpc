# Internals - Roles and Profiles

[[overview]]
Overview
--------

The Puppet configuration for HPC clusters has been designed following
the "Roles and Profiles" pattern. The Puppet code is organized in
different levels of abstraction : * Roles, which represent the business
logic. A node includes one role, and one only. Each role lists one or
more profiles. * Profiles, which represent the implementation of
technical functionalities. A profile includes and manages modules to
define a logical technical stack. * Modules, which are the elementary
technical blocks. Modules should only be responsible for managing
aspects of the component they are written for and should be as generic
as possible.
